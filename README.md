Text Classification with Naive Bayes: Implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or non-spam by analyzing word frequency distributions. The model leverages the power of probabilistic reasoning to determine the likelihood of an email being spam based on its content.

Efficient Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical feature vectors, optimizing the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficiency in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails.

Tech: Python, Scikit-learn, Naive Bayes, TF-IDF, Pandas, NLTK
